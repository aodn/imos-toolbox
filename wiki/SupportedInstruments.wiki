= Supported Instruments =

This page lists the instruments which are supported by the toolbox, and the data formats required for each instrument.

== Seabird SBE37/SBE39 ==

The toolbox can read in data that has been downloaded from an SBE37 'Microcat' CTP sensor or an SBE39 temperature/pressure sensor

The following variants of the SBE37 exist:
 * SBE37-IM
 * SBE37-IMP
 * SBE37-SM  (RS232)
 * SBE37-SM  (RS485)
 * SBE37-SMP (RS232)
 * SBE37-SMP (RS485)
 * SBE37-SI  (RS232)
 * SBE37-SI  (RS485)
 * SBE37-SIP (RS232)
 * SBE37-SIP (RS485)

The following variants of the SBE39 exist:
 * SBE39
 * SBE39-IM

The SBE output format is configurable, and there are slight differences in 
output formats between variants. Additionally, instruments which run an
older firmware version use different commands for configuring the output 
format and downloading data. The toolbox will only parse sample data
which is in the following format:

{{{
  temperature[, conductivity][, pressure][, salinity], date, time
}}}
where

 * `temperaturee`: floating point, Degrees Celsius ITS-90
 * `conductivity`: floating point, S/m (only on SBE37)
 * `pressure`:     floating point, decibars, optional (present on instruments with optional pressure sensor)
 * `salinity`: floating point, PSU, optional (may be present on SBE37 instruments with firmware >= 3.0)
 * `date`: dd mmm yyyy (e.g. 01 Jan 2008)
 * `time`: hh:mm:ss    (e.g. 15:45:03)

All SBE37 variants can be configured to output this format. SBE39 variants provide data in this format only. On SBE37 instruments running firmware < 3.0, the sensor should be configured as follows:

{{{
  Format=1
}}}

For instruments running firmware >= 3.0:

{{{
OutputFormat=1
OutputDepth=N   (if sensor supports this command)
OutputSal=N     (if sensor supports this command - Y if you want salinity)
OutputSV=N
OutputDensity=N (if sensor supports this command)
OutputTime=Y    (if sensor supports this command)
}}}

The input file must also contain a header section which contains sensor 
metadata and calibration information (as obtained via the 'DS' and 'DC' 
commands) - this is the output format provided by the Windows seaterm 
program.
