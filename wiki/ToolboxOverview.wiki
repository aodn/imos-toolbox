== Overview ==

The IMOS Matlab Toolbox aims to provide an automated, easy to use interface for converting raw instrument data into IMOS compatible NetCDF files, ready for handover to eMII. The first stage of this project is underway, and is specifically targeting 'delayed mode' data; in other words, data which is manually retrieved from long-term mooring sites. 

Typical usage of the Toolbox would proceed as follows:

 # User downloads data set from an instrument supported by the Toolbox (e.g. SBE37).
 # User imports data set into Toolbox along with a deployment data base containing metadata.
 # User performs pre-processing routines over data set, such as depth calculation for each sensor, time offset to UTC time...
 # User executes semi-automatic QC procedures over data set, such as in/out of water flagging, spike detection, outlier checks, flatline checks...
 # User performs manual QC over data via interactive display.
 # Toolbox generates eMII/IMOS compatible NetCDF files containing metadata and data at raw and QC'd levels.

While the Toolbox will be designed to execute with minimal user intervention (apart from semi-automatic QC procedures configuration and manual quality control), the Matlab source will be available for users who wish to [ContributeToTheCode contribute] to the existing code with new features, have more fine grained control over the execution flow, or who wish to integrate the Toolbox into an existing Matlab codebase. The Toolbox will be made available to, and will hopefully be useful for, all IMOS facilities.

== System requirements ==

System requirements for using the Toolbox are as follows:

 * Windows operating system (XP from Seven should be supported)
 * Java Runtime Environment 1.6
 * (Optional) Local deployment database
 * (Optional) Matlab R 2010b (A self-contained executable version is available)
 
== Using the toolbox ==

See how to [ToolboxInstallation install], [ToolboxConfiguration configure] and [UsingTheToolboxOverview use] the toolbox in the corresponding pages.

== Deployment database ==

The deployment database is a MS Access database which is local to each site, and which conforms to the deployment database schema developed at AIMS. The deployment database is used to store metadata for every deployment of interest to the site. The toolbox should always be used with a deployment database. Otherwise more work is required by the user in filling out metadata for each data set and some important pre-processing/quality control procedures won't be available.

The deployment data contains metadata for all aspects of a deployment, including instrument/sensor/platform model and calibration information, and deployment location/depth. This information is used by the Toolbox for the generation of MEST compatible metadata documents, and metadata fields in the NetCDF files. See [ftp://dataupload.emii.org.au/pub/Toolbox_documents/deployment_database_conventions.pdf deployment database conventions] to have an idea on how to document your local deployment database.

== Supported instruments ==

See the SupportedInstruments page for a detailed list of currently supported instruments.

In order for the Toolbox to be useful for a variety of instruments, the input format for a particular instrument must sometimes be provided in a standard format, or a limited set of formats.

== Pre-processing routines ==

#See the PPRoutines page for a detailed list of currently available pre-processing routines.

== Quality control procedures ==

See the QCProcedures page for a detailed list of currently available quality control procedures.

IMOS quantitative scale flag follows the IOC scale flag. See description [ProcessLevelsAndQC#Quality_Control here].

== Output format ==

The Toolbox generates NetCDF files according to the [http://imos.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/shared/emii/IMOS_netCDF_usermanual_v1.2.pdf IMOS NetCDF User Manual] and the [http://imos.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/shared/emii/IMOS_netCDF_filenaming_convention_v1.3.pdf IMOS file naming convention]. 

Global and variables attributes can be automatically documented via [NetCDFTemplates configurable template files].

== Processed data levels ==

The following levels of processed data will be saved as separate NetCDF files:

 * Level 0: Raw (non QC'd) data
 * Level 1: QC'd data

These [ProcessLevelsAndQC#ProcessLevels levels] (and the output files) map directly to the Processed Data levels defined in the [http://imos.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/shared/emii/IMOS_netCDF_usermanual_v1.2.pdf IMOS NetCDF User's Manual].
