== Overview ==

The IMOS Matlab Toolbox aims to provide an automated, easy to use interface for converting raw instrument data into IMOS/MEST compatible files, ready for handover to eMII. The first stage of this project is underway, and is specifically targeting 'delayed mode' data; in other words, data which is manually retrived from long-term mooring sites. Real time data will be addressed in a later stage of the project, and will likely leverage existing infrastructure which is under development at AIMS.

Typical usage of the Toolbox would proceed as follows:

 # User downloads data set from an instrument supported by the Toolbox (e.g. SBE37).
 # User imports data set into Toolbox.
 # Toolbox executes automatic QC procedures over data set, including in/out of water trimming, despiking, outlier checks, flatline checks, time drift correction.
 # User performs manual QC over data via interactive display.
 # Toolbox generates data set metadata in MEST compatible format.
 # Toolbox generates eMII/IMOS compatible NetCDF files containing raw and QC'd data sets.

While the Toolbox will be designed to execute with minimal user intervention (apart from manual quality control), the Matlab source will be available for users who wish to have more fine grained control over the execution flow, or who wish to integrate the Toolbox into an existing Matlab codebase. The Toolbox will be made available to, and will hopefully be useful for, all IMOS facilities.

== System requirements ==

System requirements for using the Toolbox are as follows:

 * Java Runtime Environment 1.5
 * JDBC driver for MS Access
 * Local deployment database
 * Matlab (optional; a self-contained executable version will be made available)

== Supported instruments ==

Initially, the following instruments will be supported:

 * SBE37
 * SBE39
 * WQM

As development progresses, support will be added for at least the following instruments:

 * FSI/NIX
 * WXT-520
 * ADCP
   * Nortek (Continental/AWACs)
   * Teledyne/RDI
 * !WaveData
 * SBE21

== Automatic quality control procedures ==

The following automatic quality control procedures will be available in the Toolbox:

 * Range checks
 * In/out of water trimming
 * Flatline checks
 * Despiking
 * Time drift correction
 * Time centring (for averaged data)

Automatic QC parameters for specific instrument/parameter types (e.g. maximum/minimum values for range checking) will be retrieved from the local deployment database. It is intended that this information become part of the deployment database schema.

== Manual quality control procedures ==

The following manual quality control procedures will be available in the Toolbox:

 * Linear calibration correction
 * Detrending
 * Flagging/commenting on questionable points/regions of data via point/click/drag interface.

Manual quality control will be aided by the following visualisation techniques:

 * Summary plots (timeseries subplot of each level of processed data)
 * Coverage plots (to highlight missing data)
 * Stick plots
 * Parameter-parameter plots
 * Consolidated plots

It is intended that the visualisation aspect of the Toolbox will be usable during deployment/retrieval for quick visualisation/verification of instrument data.

== Processed data levels ==

The following levels of processed data will be saved as separate NetCDF files:

 * Level 0: Raw (unprocessed) data
 * Level 1: QC'd data

These levels (and the output files) map directly to the Processed Data levels defined in the IMOS NetCDF User's Manual. Other process levels may be added as deemed appropriate.

== Standardisation of instrument formats ==

In order for the Toolbox to be useful for a variety of instruments, the input format for a particular instrument must be provided in a standard format, or a limited set of formats. The Toolbox documentation will specify correct configurations for all supported instruments.

== Project hosting ==

The project is hosted on Google Code at http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/

== Deployment database ==

The deployment database is a MS Access database which is local to each site, and which conforms to the deployment database schema developed at AIMS. The deployment database is used to store metadata for every deployment of interest to the site.

The deployment data contains metadata for all aspects of a deployment, including instrument/sensor/platform model and calibration information, and deployment location/depth. This information is used by the Toolbox for the generation of MEST compatible metadata documents, and metadata fields in the NetCDF files.
