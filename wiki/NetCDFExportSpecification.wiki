= NetCDF Compliance =

A function called `makeNetCDFCompliant` is called after data has been imported; this function uses the NetCDF template engine, described [NetCDFTemplates here], to add NetCDF attributes to the `sample_data struct. Templates for quality control variables are executed just before export to NetCDF.

= NetCDF Exporter =

The NetCDF exporter generates IMOS compliant NetCDF files, using information from the `sample_data` struct. The `sample_data` structs are maintained in more or less the same format that is required by the IMOS NetCDF standard, so the exporter's job is very simple.
