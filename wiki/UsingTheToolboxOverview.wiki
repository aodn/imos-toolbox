= Using the Toolbox =

This page gives a brief overview on how to configure and use the toolbox. As development of the toolbox progresses, this page will be updated. Additionally, my aim is to reduce the amount of work required to configure the toolbox.

This page also shows the current state of the toolbox GUI. Feedback, both positive and negative, is more than welcome. Please make criticisms, suggestions and comments, if you have any, so that I can design the GUI to be as useful as possible.

== Configuration ==

Before you can use the toolbox, you must configure the matlab path and deployment database.

=== Matlab path ===

The toolbox root, and every subdirectory within the toolbox root must be on the matlab path. In other words, you must add the following list of directories (valid as of the 7th May 2009) to your matlab path, either by setting the `MATLABPATH` environment variable, or, within matlab, using the 'Set Path' dialog, which is accessed via 'File'->'Set Path'. 

Assuming that the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, you must add the following directories to the path:
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\AutomaticQC`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\DDB`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\FlowManager`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\GUI`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\IMOS`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Java`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\NetCDF`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Parser`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Tests` (optional)

=== Deployment Databse ===

Under Windows, the deployment database (hereafter referred to as the ddb) is accessed as an ODBC data source:

 * Start
  * Control Panel
   * Administrative Tools
    * Data Sources (ODBC)
     * User DSN
      * Add 
       * Driver: "Microsoft Access Driver (`*`.mdb)"
       * Data Source Name: "imos-ddb" (or whatever you wish to call it)
       * Select -> navigate to the ddb MS Access file

Once you have configured the ddb as an ODBC source, set the `toolbox.ddb` property (in `toolboxProperties.txt`) to the ODBC Data Source Name.

THe ddb is accessed via Java code, thus you must also let Matlab know where the Java classes are, by editing `classpath.txt`. Assuming that matlab is installed in `C:\matlab`, and the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, add the following line to the file `C:\matlab\toolbox\local\classpath.txt`:
{{{
C:\imos-toolbox\Java\bin
}}}

== Startup ==

The GUI is currently quite limited in what you can achieve. All you can really do is choose which data you wish to import; you are then left to your own devices in the matlab command window as to what you do with the data. 

The toolbox is currently started via the `importManager` function, which prompts you for the data you wish to import, then loads and returns the data as `sample_data` and `cal_data` cell arrays (see the [DataStructures data structures] overview for the layout of these structures).

Start the toolbox like so:
{{{
>> [s c m] = importManager
}}}

The import manager returns 3 output arguments:
 * `s`: A cell array of `sample_data` structs, one for the data that was imported from each physical instrument.
 * `c`: A cell array of `cal_data` structs, corresponding to the `sample_data` structs in `s`.
 * `m`: A vector of `DeploymentData` structs, containing any deployments for which the data could not be imported (e.g. if the information in the ddb was incorrect, or the raw data files were missing).

When you start the import manager, you are first presented with the following dialog:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_startDialog.png

Choose the field trip in which you are interested, and the directory which contains the raw data related to that field trip. You are able to use the top buttons to select a date range over which to filter the list of field trips to choose from.

Once you have selected a field trip and data directory, the toolbox will attempt to match up deployments with raw data files. You will then be presented with the following dialog:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_dataFileStatusDialog.png

The top half of the dialog contains the list of all deployments related to the field trip; the bottom half contains the list of all files which were found, that correspond to the currently selected deployment.

Some of the deployments are highlighed:

 * A <font color="red">red deployment</font> indicates that the information in the ddb was invalid.
 * A *bold deployment* indicates that the toolbox could not find any files related to that deployment.
 * An _italicised deployment_ indicates that multiple files were found for that deployment. This will be the norm for e.g. ADCP instruments which store their data over multiple files. For other instruments (e.g. CTDs) this may indicate an error in the ddb, or in the data file naming scheme.

The dialog allows you to resolve any discrepancies between the information in ddb and the raw data files, by removing deployments, and adding/removing files to/from deployments.

When you are happy with the list of deployments for which data is to be imported, confirm the dialog; you will be presented with a progress bar while the data is imported:

When the data has been imported, you will be presented ... no, wait ... from here on in, you're on your own.
