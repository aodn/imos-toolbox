= Using the Toolbox =

This page gives a brief overview on how to use the toolbox. You are encouraged to provide feedback on any aspect of the toolbox (e.g. is the user interface intuitive, easy to use?). Check out the [ToolboxInstallation installation] instructions for details on how to get the toolbox up and running.

== Starting the toolbox ==

Before starting the toolbox, keep in mind that you will need to [ToolboxConfiguration configure] it first, especially by setting your deployment database, your use mode timeSeries or profile and your NetCDF templates.

=== Interactive execution ===

 * The standalone version of the toolbox is started by double clicking on the relevant `.bat` or `.sh` file depending on your operating system.

 * If you are using the toolbox within Matlab, the toolbox is started via the `imosToolbox` function:
{{{
>> imosToolbox
}}}

=== Automatic execution ===

The toolbox can be executed in an automatic manner, by passing some arguments to the `imosToolbox` function. A deployment database must be present in order to run the toolbox automatically. When you pass the string `'auto'` to the `imosToolbox` function, the toolbox will import all of the files specified in the deployment database, using the field trip and data directory specified in `toolboxProperties.txt`, run the data sets through the default set of automatic pre-processing and QC routines, and export the data sets as NetCDF to the default export directory :

 * For example using the standalone Windows 32bit version, you can use the `imosToolboxBatch_Win32.bat` file which contains the default following code :
{{{
imosToolbox_Win32.exe auto
pause
}}}
Just double click on this file to execute it.

 * Using the source code within MATLAB just proceed as follow :
{{{
>> imosToolbox auto
}}}

Alternatively, you can specify the field trip, data directory, pre-processing routines, QC routines and export directory as arguments to `imosToolbox` :

 * For example using the standalone Windows 32bit version, edit the `imosToolboxBatch_Win32.bat` file so that it includes something like :

{{{
imosToolbox_Win32.exe auto "4788" "C:\Raw Data\" "{'depthPP' 'salinityPP' 'magneticDeclinationPP'}" "{'imosImpossibleDateQC' 'imosImpossibleLocationSetQC' 'imosInOutWaterQC' 'imosGlobalRangeQC' 'imosRegionalRangeQC' 'imosImpossibleDepthQC' 'imosRateOfChangeQC' 'imosStationarityQC' 'imosSalinityFromPTQC' 'imosSideLobeContSetQC' 'imosTeledyneSetQC'}" "C:\NetCDF\"
pause
}}}

You can add as many lines in the `imosToolboxBatch_Win32.bat` file as mooring deployments that need to be processed sequentially.

 * Using the source code within MATLAB just type as follow :

{{{
>> imosToolbox auto '4788' 'C:\Raw Data\' {'depthPP' 'salinityPP' 'magneticDeclinationPP'} {'imosImpossibleDateQC' 'imosImpossibleLocationSetQC' 'imosInOutWaterQC' 'imosGlobalRangeQC' 'imosRegionalRangeQC' 'imosImpossibleDepthQC' 'imosRateOfChangeQC' 'imosStationarityQC' 'imosSalinityFromPTQC' 'imosSideLobeContSetQC' 'imosTeledyneSetQC'} 'C:\NetCDF\'
}}}

If no pre-processing or quality control routine should be performed then provide an empty cell array `{}`.

== Importing data ==

=== Without deployment database ===

Upon starting the toolbox, you will be prompted to select a raw data file to import:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_manual_import.png

Once you choose a file, you will be prompted to choose which parser to use to import the data. Choose the parser appropriate for the file.

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_manual_parser.png

=== With deployment database ===

Upon starting the toolbox, you are first presented with the following dialog:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_startDialog.png

Choose the field trip in which you are interested, and the directory which contains the raw data related to that field trip. You can use the top buttons to select a date range over which to filter the list of field trips to choose from.

Once you have selected a field trip and data directory, the toolbox will attempt to match up deployments with raw data files. You will then be presented with the following dialog:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_dataFileStatusDialog.png

The top half of the dialog contains the list of all deployments related to the field trip; the bottom half contains the list of all files which were found, that correspond to the currently selected deployment.

Some of the deployments are highlighed:

 * A <font color="red">red deployment</font> indicates that the information in the ddb was invalid.
 * A *bold deployment* indicates that the toolbox could not find any files related to that deployment.
 * An _italicised deployment_ indicates that multiple files were found for that deployment. This will be the norm for instruments which store their data over multiple files. For other instruments this may indicate an error in the ddb, or in the data file naming scheme.

The dialog allows you to resolve any discrepancies between the information in ddb and the raw data files, by removing deployments, and adding/removing files to/from deployments.

When you are happy with the list of deployments for which data is to be imported, confirm the dialog; you will be presented with a progress bar while the data is imported:

== Preprocessing data ==

After import, you may be presented with a dialog allowing you to choose from a list of preprocessing routines:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_preprocess.png

== Viewing data ==

When the data has been imported, you will be presented with the main window, which allows you to view the sample data, data set by data set. You can use zoom in zoom out and pan functions. With the panel at the bottom left you can choose to omit parameters. Below is the TimSeries view which is the default view in timeSeris mode :

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_main_window.png

Use the drop down menu at the top left window to select the data set to view.

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_list_datasets.png

You can tune the colorbar colormap and color range settings by right-clicking on the colorbar and using the context menu. Each family of parameters has it own context menu with different default settings:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_colorbar_ranges_dialog.png

If your data set has a depth dimension or variable, you can view the data as a depth profile, by selecting '!DepthProfile' (default view in profile mode) from the graph list at the top right of the window:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_depth_profile.png

Similarly, for data with latitude/longitude variables, you can view the data as transects:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_transect.png

== Metadata ==

By clicking on the 'Metadata' button on the left, you can view and modify metadata (common metadata entries can even be replicated accross data sets from the current one being displayed by clicking on the 'Replicate' button):

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_metadata.png

This is possible for global attributes as well as any variable attribute by using the drop down menu at the top of the metadata panel.

== Quality Control ==

By clicking on the 'QC data' button, you can choose to run the data through a set of automatic QC filters, which will automatically flag the data sets. The flags will be overlaid on the graphs:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_QC_dialog.png

You can see that a few data points have been flagged. 

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_main_window_QC.png

You can display the actual label associated with the overlaying color of the flag by right-clicking on it.

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_main_window_QC_labels.png

To manually QC some data samples, you can use click+drag a box to select them. Use the left mouse button to select all data points, and the right mouse button to select already-flagged data points. The selected data points are highlighted in white.

Clicking on a set of selected data points will bring up a dialog, allowing you to set the QC flag on those points. The options will be different depending on which QC set you are using.

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_manual_QC_dialog.png

When you confirm the flag dialog, you will see that the flag values for the selected data points have changed.

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_manual_QC_result.png

By clicking on the 'QC stats' button, you can access the details of each QC procedure result on each parameter data set per dataset:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_main_window_QC_stats.png

Clicking on a specific cell in the QC stat table displays the full details, procedure's parameters applied included:

== Menu features ==

The menu panel can give you access to this google wiki page to look for help:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_menu_help.png

You can also plot a common variable to some data sets on the same figure:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_menu_mooring_variables.png

useful to monitor instruments measurements against each others:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_mooring_instruments_depth.png

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_mooring_instruments_temperature.png

== Export ==

Ay any time, you can click the 'Export NetCDF' button to export the data sets to IMOS compliant NetCDF files. You can choose to omit specific variables, and to export non QC'd data, QC'd data or both:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/gui_export.png

An export configuration (common variable(s) and/or QC level omited) can be replicated accross all the data sets from the current one being displayed by clicking on on the 'Replicate' button.

You will be presented with a similar dialog upon clicking the 'Export Raw' button, which allows you to copy the original raw data files, renamed with an IMOS compliant file name.
