#summary Thoughts on Process Levels and Quality Control

<wiki:toc/>

= Process Levels =

The [http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/wiki/documents\IMOS_netCDF_filenaming_convention_v1.4.pdf IMOS NetCDF File Naming Convention] defines five data process levels, as described in the table below. One NetCDF file will only contain one process level. This means that the output from processing a data set could consist of up to five NetCDF files.

The IMOS Toolbox produces data to fit only within the first two levels - raw and QC'd data. Raw (level 0) data is that which has been retrieved directly from the instrument(s). QC-d (level 1) data is that which has been passed through pre-processing routines, automatic and manual quality control procedures. The pre-processing routines will potentially transform data values and/or add new derived parameters. The manual and automatic quality control procedures will potentially flag data in the dataset, for example to flag outliers and spikes.

== IMOS data process level definitions ==

|| *Level* || *File Version* || *Brief Description* || *Detailed Description* ||
|| 0 || FV00 || Raw Data || Raw data is defined as unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone quality control. The data may be in engineering units or physical units, time and locations details can be in relative units and values can be pre-calibration measurements. Level 0 data is not suitable for public access within IMOS. ||
|| 1 || FV01 || Quality Controlled Data||Quality controlled data have passed quality assurance procedures such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection and removal of obvious errors. The data are in physical units using standard SI metric units with calibration and other routine pre-processing applied, all time and location values are in absolute coordinates to agreed to standards and datum, metadata exists for the data or for the higher level dataset that the data belongs to. This is the standard IMOS data level and is what should be made available to eMII and to the IMOS community. ||
|| 2 || FV02 || Derived Products || Derived products require scientific and technical interpretation. Normally these will be defined by the community that collects or utilises the data. ||
|| 3 || FV03 || Interpreted Products || These products require researcher driven analysis and interpretation, model based interpretation using other data and / or strong prior assumptions. ||
|| 4 || FV04 || Knowledge Products || These products require researcrher driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and / or strong prior assumptions. ||

= Quality Control =

Every data point in an IMOS NetCDF file has an associated quality control flag value which indicates the trustworthiness of the data. There are a number of different sets of QC flags which are available for use; the standard IMOS set is shown below. 

A file can either contain one 'blanket' QC value which is attributed to every data point, or an individual QC value for every data point. For example, in a raw data file, every point will have the same QC flag, ('0' if using the standard IMOS QC set).

== IMOS standard QC set ==

|| *Flag Value* || *Meaning* || *Description* ||
|| 0 || No QC performed || The level at which all data enter the working archive. They have not yet been quality controlled. ||
|| 1 || Good data || Top quality data in which no malfunctions have been identified and all real features have been verified during the quality control process. ||
|| 2 || Probably good data || Good data in which some features (probably real) are present but these are unconfirmed. Code 2 data are also data in which minor malfunctions may be present but these errors are small and / or can be successfully corrected without seriously affecting the overall quality of the data. ||
|| 3 || Bad data that are potentially correctable || Suspect data in which unusual, and probably erroneous features are observed. ||
|| 4 || Bad data || Obviously erroneous values are observed. ||
|| 5 || Value Changed || Altered by a QC Centre, with original values (before the change) preserved in the history record of the profile. ||
|| 6 || Not used || Flag 6 is reserved for future use. ||
|| 7 || Not used || Flag 7 is reserved for future use. ||
|| 8 || Not used || Flag 8 is reserved for future use. ||
|| 9 || Missing Value || Indicates that the element is missing. ||
