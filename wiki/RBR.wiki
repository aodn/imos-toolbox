= RBR supported instruments =

This page lists the RBR instrument Models which are supported by the toolbox, and the data formats required for each of them. If you have some data from an unsupported instrument or format, send me an [http://code.google.com/u/guillaume.galibert/ email], or leave a comment on this page with files examples, and I'll look into adding support for this new instrument/format.

=== DR-1050 ===

The file format for DR-1050 loggers is supported by the *DR1050* parser and consists of a header section, and a list of pressure samples:

=== XR, and TR ===

The toolbox is able to read various XR and TR file formats using the *XR* parser.

The supported file formats so far are as follow : 

 * XR-420 data files generated by either RBR Windows v6.13 software or Ruskin software v1.5.25 and v1.7 with output in Engineering unit .txt format.
 * TDR-2050 data files generated by either RBR Windows v6.13 software or Ruskin software v1.5.25 and v1.7 with output in Engineering unit .txt format.
 * XR-620 data files, but only those generated by Ruskin software v1.5.25 and v1.7 with output in Engineering unit .txt format. 
 * TR-1060 data files, but only those generated by Ruskin software v1.5.25 and v1.7 with output in Engineering unit .txt format. 
 * TWR-2050 data files, but only those generated by RBR Windows v6.13 software.

Supported date format are either 'yy/mm/dd HH:MM:SS.FFF' or 'yyyy/mmm/dd HH:MM:SS.FFF'. Date format 'dd-mmm-yyyy HH:MM:SS.FFF' is also supported for Ruskin software v1.7.

The file format consists of a header section, and a list of data samples of conductivity, temperature, pressure, fluorometry-chlorophyll, etc... when those variables are present.

Supported variable titles in file are as follow :

 * Cond
 * Temp
 * Pres
 * !FlCa
 * FlC
 * Turb
 * R_Temp
 * R_D_O2
 * Depth
 * Salin
 * !SpecCond
 * !DensAnom
 * SoSUN
 * rdO2C
