=== Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error ===

Upon executing the standalone version of the toolbox, you may be presented with the following error dialog:

http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/r6034.png

This is a Matlab problem, as described in this bug report (Mathworks login required): http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/531531

You can overcome this problem by following the instructions in the bug report in the se4ction *For standalone executables and C/C++ shared libraries Using Lcc-win32 compiler*. All you have to do is create a plain text file called `imosToolbox.exe.manifest` (make sure the `.txt` extension is not present) in the `imos-toolbox` directory, which contains the following:

{{{
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes'?> 
<assembly xmlns='urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1' manifestVersion='1.0'> 
  <dependency> 
    <dependentAssembly> 
      <assemblyIdentity type='win32' name='Microsoft.VC80.CRT' version='8.0.50727.762' processorArchitecture='x86' publicKeyToken='1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b' /> 
    </dependentAssembly> 
  </dependency> 
</assembly>
}}}

With this file, the toolbox should start without issue.
