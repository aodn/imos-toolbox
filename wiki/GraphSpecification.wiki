#summary Overview of Graph functions

<wiki:toc/>

= Graph Specification =

The Graph subdirectory provides functions which allow the user to plot and interact with data. The Graph subdirectory (and naming convention) is modularised down to groups of functions specific to graph and parameter types. An example Graph subdirectory is shown below:

 * `Graph/`
  * `graphTimeSeries.m`
  * `TimeSeries/`
   * `graphTimeSeriesX.m`
   * `graphTimeSeriesGeneric.m`
   * `highlightTimeSeriesX.m`
   * `highlightTimeSeriesGeneric.m`
   * `selectTimeSeriesX.m`
   * `selectTimeSeriesGeneric.m`
   * `flagTimeSeries.m`
   * `selectTimeSeriesGeneric.m`
  * `OtherGraph/`
   * `graphOtherGraphX.m`
   * `graphOtherGraphGeneric.m`
   * `highlightOtherGraphX.m`
   * `highlightOtherGraphGeneric.m`
   * `selectOtherGraphX.m`
   * `selectOtherGraphGeneric.m`
   * `flagOtherGraphX.m`
   * `flagOtherGraphGeneric.m`
  * ...
   
== `graph` functions ==

Functions of the name `graphX.m` (where `X` is the graph type) define the graphing options which are made available to the user. Each graph type has its own directory (e.g. `Graph/graphTimeSeries.m` is mapped to the `Graph/TimeSeries/` directory), which contains functions related to that graph type. The `graphX.m` functions use the `graphXY.m` functions to graph a set of variables.

Top level graph functions (i.e. `graphX.m`) have the following format:
{{{
function [graphs handles] = graphGraphType( parent, sample_data, vars )
}}}
where
 * `parent` is a handle to the parent GUI container (e.g. a `figure` or `uipanel`) in which to graph the data
 * `sample_data` is a struct containing the sample data
 * `vars` is a vector of indices into the `sample_data.variables` cell array, defining the variables which are to be graphed
 * `graphs` is a vector of axes handles
 * `handles` is a vector of data handles (e.g. `line`, `scatter`, `surface` etc).

Functions of the name `graphXY.m` (where `X` is the graph type and `Y` is the parameter) provide logic to graph a single variable. These functions have the following format:
{{{
function h = graphGraphTypeParameter( ax, sample_data, var )
}}}
where
 * `ax` is a handle to the axis in which the data should be graphed
 * `sample_data` is the struct containing the sample data
 * `var` is an index into the `sample_data.variables` cell array, defining the variable to be graphed.
 * `h` is a handle to the data that was graphed (e.g. `line`)

== `flag` functions ==

Functions of the name `flagX.m` and `flagXY.m` follow the same meaning and naming convention as the `graph` functions, except the purpose of the `flag` functions is to overlay QC flag data on existing graphs.

== `select` functions ==

Functions of the name `selectXY.m` (where `X` is the graph type, and `Y` is the parameter type) add logic to a graph which allows the user to select a range of data.

== `highlight` functions ==

Functions of the name `highlightXY.m` (where `X` is the graph type, and `Y` is the parameter type) overlay a given data range onto an existing graph.
