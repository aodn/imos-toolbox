== System Architecture ==

This diagram shows the program structure.

The *Flow Manager* controls program flow, for example, ensuring that the user cannot apply manual QC procedures before running automatic QC procedures.

The *Import Manager* manages the import of data into the toolbox; it uses the relevant  *[ParserSpecification Parser]* module to import instrument data from raw files.

The *Display Manager* manages data visualisation and interaction (e.g. GUI logic for manual QC).

The *Auto QC Manager* provides procedures for automatic flagging of suspect data. It uses the *[AutoQCSpecification Automatic QC]* filters.


The *Export Manager* exports data to IMOS compliant NetCDF files.
