== System Architecture ==

This diagram shows the program structure.

The *Flow Manager* controls program flow, for example, ensuring that the user cannot apply manual QC procedures before running automatic QC procedures.

The *Import Manager* manages the import of data into the toolbox; it uses the relevant  *[ParserSpecification Parser]* module to import instrument data from raw files.

The *Display Manager* manages data visualisation.

The *Process Manager* manages transitions between data process levels (i.e. raw, auto-QC'd, manual-QC'd etc.).

The *[AutoQCSpecification Automatic QC]* module provides procedures for automatic flagging of suspect data.

The *Manual QC* module provides procedures allowing the user to manually flag/correct suspect data.

The *NetCDF Exporter* exports data to IMOS compliant NetCDF files.
