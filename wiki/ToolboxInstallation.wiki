= Toolbox Installation =

This page provides an overview of the steps required in order to get a source based release of the IMOS Toolbox up and running. For notes on standalone versions of the toolbox, see the WeeklySnapshots page.

== Requirements ==

 * Windows XP
 * Matlab (r 2008a or newer)
 * Java JRE (1.5 or newer)
 * (Optional) A deployment database which contains some data (have a look at the deployment database [http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/documents/deployment_database_conventions.pdf guidelines].

The toolbox will run under Linux. If you are using a deployment database however, MS Access support under Linux is flaky at best. Having said that, I've developed the toolbox almost exclusively under Ubuntu 9.04 (testing under Windows regularly, of course). See [DeploymentDatabaseInterface here] for more details on running the toolbox under Linux.

== Download and install ==

Download a source archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/downloads/list downloads] page. Extract the archive to a directory of your choice. Before you can use the toolbox, you must configure the matlab path and deployment database.

== Matlab path ==

The toolbox root, and every subdirectory within the toolbox root must be on the matlab path. In other words, you must add the following list of directories to your matlab path, either by setting the `MATLABPATH` environment variable, or, within matlab, using the 'Set Path' dialog, which is accessed via 'File'->'Set Path'. 

Assuming that the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, you must add the following directories to the path:
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\AutomaticQC`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\DDB`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\FlowManager`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph`
    * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph\TimeSeries`
    * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph\DepthProfile`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\GUI`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\IMOS`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\NetCDF`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Parser`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Preprocessing`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Util`

== Deployment Databse ==

Under Windows, the deployment database (hereafter referred to as the ddb) is accessed as an ODBC data source:

 * Start
  * Control Panel
   * Administrative Tools
    * Data Sources (ODBC)
     * User DSN
      * Add 
       * Driver: "Microsoft Access Driver (`*`.mdb)"
       * Data Source Name: "imos-ddb" (or whatever you wish to call it)
       * Select -> navigate to the ddb MS Access file

Once you have configured the ddb as an ODBC source, set the `toolbox.ddb` property (in `toolboxProperties.txt`) to the ODBC Data Source Name. If you are not using a deployment database, ensure the `toolbox.ddb` property is unset.

The ddb is accessed via Java code, thus you must also let Matlab know where the Java classes are, by editing `classpath.txt`. Assuming that matlab is installed in `C:\matlab`, and the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, add the following line to the file `C:\matlab\toolbox\local\classpath.txt`:
{{{
C:\imos-toolbox\Java\ddb.jar
}}}

== Startup ==

You should now be able to start matlab and run the toolbox. Before executing the `imosToolbox` function, you must first navigate to the installation directory:
{{{
>> cd C:\imos-toolbox
>> imosToolbox
}}}

See the [UsingTheToolboxOverview overview] on using the toolbox to get started.
