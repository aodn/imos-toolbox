= Toolbox Installation =

This page provides an overview of the steps required in order to get the IMOS Toolbox up and running.

== Standalone installation ==

=== Requirements ===

 * Windows XP
 * (Optional) A deployment database which contains some data (have a look at the deployment database [http://imos-toolbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/documents/deployment_database_conventions.pdf guidelines]). 
 * (Optional) Java JRE (1.5 or newer). Only required if you are using a deployment database.

=== Install Matlab Runtime ===

In order to run the standalone version of the Toolbox, you must first install the Matlab Component Runtime (MCR). You can download the proper MCR installer [ftp://dataupload.emii.org.au/pub/software/MCRInstaller here] :

 * imos-toolbox version 1.5 : MCRInstaller_7.10.exe
 * imos-toolbox version 1.5.5 : MCRInstaller_7.12.exe
 * imos-toolbox > version 1.5.5 : MCRInstaller_7.14.exe

The installer is a straightforward Windows installer; you only need to run it once. After you've downloaded the file, double click on it, and follow the instructions. During installation, you might be warned about requiring the .NET Framework - you may safely ignore this warning.

=== Install IMOS Toolbox ===

Download a standalone archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/downloads/list downloads] page. Extract the archive to a directory of your choice. 

=== Configure Deployment Database ===

Since imos-toolbox versions strictly above 1.5.5, in addition to the MS-Access deployment database, it is also possible to connect to any user-specific database.

If you are using the MS-Access deployment database, you must configure it as an ODBC source:

 * Start
  * Control Panel
   * Administrative Tools
    * Data Sources (ODBC)
     * User DSN
      * Add 
       * Driver: "Microsoft Access Driver (`*`.mdb)"
       * Data Source Name: "imos-ddb" (or whatever you wish to call it)
       * Select -> navigate to the ddb MS Access file

Once you have configured the ddb as an ODBC source, set the `toolbox.ddb` property (in `toolboxProperties.txt`) to the ODBC Data Source Name. If you are not using a deployment database, ensure the `toolbox.ddb` property is unset.

If you are using your own database, you must put the driver (.jar file) used to connect to it in the Java directory and set the `toolbox.ddb.*` properties (in `toolboxProperties.txt`) properly.

You must also follow a [DeploymentDatabase#Interface_requirements minimum interface requirements] to prevent the toolbox from crashes.

=== Startup ===

Start the toolbox by double clicking on `imosToolbox.exe`.

== Source installation ==

=== Requirements ===

 * Windows XP
 * Matlab (r 2008a or newer)
 * (Optional) A deployment database which contains some data
 * (Optional) Java JRE (1.5 or newer). Only required if you are using a deployment database.

=== Download and install ===

Download a source archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/downloads/list downloads] page. Extract the archive to a directory of your choice. Before you can use the toolbox, you must configure the matlab path and deployment database.

=== Matlab path ===

The toolbox root, and every subdirectory within the toolbox root must be on the matlab path. In other words, you must add the following list of directories to your matlab path, either by setting the `MATLABPATH` environment variable, or, within matlab, using the 'Set Path' dialog, which is accessed via 'File'->'Set Path'. 

Assuming that the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, you must add the following directories to the path:
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\AutomaticQC`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\DDB`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\FlowManager`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph`
    * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph\TimeSeries`
    * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph\DepthProfile`
    * `C:\imos-toolbox\Graph\Transect`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\GUI`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\IMOS`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\NetCDF`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Parser`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Preprocessing`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Seawater`
  * `C:\imos-toolbox\Util`

=== Deployment Database ===

As with a standalone installation, you must [#Configure_Deployment_Database configure your database].

The ddb is accessed via Java code, thus you must also let Matlab know where the Java classes are, by editing `classpath.txt`. Assuming that matlab is installed in `C:\matlab`, and the toolbox is installed in `C:\imos-toolbox`, add the following line to the file `C:\matlab\toolbox\local\classpath.txt`:
{{{
C:\imos-toolbox\Java\*.jar
}}}

=== Startup ===

You should now be able to start matlab and run the toolbox. Before executing the `imosToolbox` function, you must first navigate to the installation directory:
{{{
>> cd C:\imos-toolbox
>> imosToolbox
}}}

See the [UsingTheToolboxOverview overview] on using the toolbox to get started.

== Using the toolbox under Linux ==

The toolbox will run under Linux. If you are using a deployment database however, MS Access support under Linux is flaky at best. Having said that, I've developed the toolbox almost exclusively under Ubuntu 9.04 (testing under Windows regularly, of course). See [DeploymentDatabaseInterface here] for more details on running the toolbox under Linux.
