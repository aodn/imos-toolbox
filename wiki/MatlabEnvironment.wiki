This information is for my own reference, but may be of use to others.

== Matlab path ==

The toolbox has been written under the assumption that every toolbox file is on the matlab path. This means that you need to add every subdirectory in the toolbox root to the path.

I call matlab from a (bash) script which preconfigures the matlab path:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
MATLAB_HOME=/home/paul/matlab
MATLAB_WORKSPACE=/home/paul/matlab-workspace
IMOS_WORKSPACE=$MATLAB_WORKSPACE/imos-toolbox

MATLABPATH=$MATLAB_WORKSPACE/m2html
MATLABPATH=$MATLABPATH:$MATLAB_WORKSPACE/mtest
MATLABPATH=$MATLABPATH:$IMOS_WORKSPACE

ROOTS=$IMOS_WORKSPACE\ $IMOS_WORKSPACE/Graph

for R in $ROOTS
do

  DIRS=`ls $R`

  for D in $DIRS
  do

    D=$R/$D
    if [ -d $D ]
    then
      MATLABPATH=$MATLABPATH:$D
    fi

  done
done

echo $MATLABPATH
export MATLABPATH
cd $IMOS_WORKSPACE
$MATLAB_HOME/bin/matlab -desktop -nosplash
}}}

== Matlab classpath and library path ==

I have added the following to the top of both `matlab/toolbox/local/classpath.txt` and `matlab/toolbox/local/librarypath.txt`:
{{{
/home/paul/matlab-workspace/imos-toolbox/trunk/Java/bin
