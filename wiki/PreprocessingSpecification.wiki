#summary Overview of Preprocessing routines

<wiki:toc/>

= Preprocessing functions =

After importing data, the toolbox allows you to execute a configurable set of preprocessing functions over the newly imported data. A prime example of a preprocessing function is for timezone adjustment. One file exists for each preprocessing function; these functions live in the `Preprocessing` directory, and are named in the form `[function_name]PP.m`, where `function_name` is a unique name for the function.

For example, the time offset function file name is `timeOffsetPP.m`, and the function is `timeOffsetPP`.

== Function format ==

All preprocessing functions must adhere to the following format:
{{{
  function sample_data = namePP( sample_data )
}}}

where:

 * `sample_data` is a cell array of structs containing the sample data that is to be preprocessed. See the [DataStructures data structures spec] for details on these structs.
