function imosPackage()
%IMOSPACKAGE Packages a standalone version of the toolbox.
%
% This function creates a zip file containing the toolbox binaries, source, and
% configuration files. Users are able to extract this zip file, and run the
% toolbox on computers which do not have Matlab installed. The Matlab
% Component Runtime must be installed though.
%
% This function must be executed from the root of the toolbox directory 
% tree that is to be compiled. As part of the compilation process, two 
% directories are created at the same level as the toolbox directory tree: 
% 'staging', and 'imos-toolbox'. For example, if the toolbox tree is located 
% in 'C:\matlab\toolbox', the following directories will be created:
%
%   - 'C:\matlab\staging'
%   - 'C:\matlab\imos-toolbox'
%
% If either of these directories already exist, the function will fail.
% These directories are deleted after compilation. The resulting zip 
% file, named 'imos-toolbox.zip', is created from the 'imos-toolbox' 
% directory, and will be stored in the root of the toolbox directory tree 
% (i.e. the directory that the function was called from).
%
% The source code is included in the zip file because certain parts of the
% toolbox rely upon the existence of the Matlab source files. For example,
% the listParsers function scans the contents of the Parsers subdirectory
% to determine which parser functions are available. It is important to
% note that modifying these source files will not have any effect upon the 
% execution of the toolbox; all of the source files are compiled into the 
% executable. If you wish to modify the toolbox, you must execute the 
% toolbox from the source, which requires a Matlab license.
