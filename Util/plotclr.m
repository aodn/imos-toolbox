function h = plotclr(hAx, x, y, v, marker, vlim, varargin)
% plots the values of v colour coded
% at the positions specified by x and y.
% A colourbar is added on the right side of the figure.
%
% The colourbar strectches from the minimum value of v to its
% maximum.
%
% 'marker' is optional to define the marker being used. The
% default is a point. To use a different marker (such as circles, ...) send
% its symbol to the function (which must be enclosed in '; see example).
%
% 'vlim' is optional, to define the limits of the colourbar.
% v values outside vlim are not plotted
