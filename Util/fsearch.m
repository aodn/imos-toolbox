function hits = fsearch(pattern, root, restriction)
%FSEARCH Recursive file/directory search.
%
% Performs a recursive search starting at the given root directory; returns
% the names of all files and directories below the root which have a name
% matching the given string pattern using strfind(). The name comparison is case 
% insensitive for alphabetical characters.
%
% Inputs:
%
%   pattern     - Pattern to match. Can be a filename, a full path or part
%                 of a path including a filename.
%
%   root        - Directory from which to start the search.
%
%   restriction - Optional. Either 'files' or 'dirs', to restrict the search 
%                 results to contain only files or directories respectively. 
%                 If omitted, both files and directories are included in the 
%                 search results.
%
% Outputs:
% 
%   hits    - Cell array of strings containing the files/directories that
%             have a name which contains the pattern.
