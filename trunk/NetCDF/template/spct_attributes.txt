S, comment                   = This variable specifies which measurement is used to calculate the non-directional or Energy spectrum. The AWAC has three possible measurements to choose from: Pressure, Velocity, and Acoustic Surface Tracking (AST). When the Optimized option is selected, the software will use the AST as the primary means of calculating the energy spectra. If the software deems that the AST data have more than 10% outliers (bad detects), then it will revert to pressure (depth less than 20 meters) or velocity (depth greater than 20 meters) for the energy spectra.
