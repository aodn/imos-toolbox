S, abstract                     = The Great Barrier Reef Ocean Observing System (GBROOS) is a geographic node of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). GBROOS is an observation system that seeks to understand the impact of the Coral Sea, in particular cool and warm water intrusions, on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) of North Eastern Australia. The heart of GBROOS is an array of moorings along the GBR designed to monitor the flow of oceanic water along and into the reef matrix. The moorings are set up as pairs with one offshore deeper slope mooring and one inshore shelf mooring. Pairs of moorings are located in the northern, central and southern parts of the GBR. Delayed mode data from the moorings is obtained every six months as the instruments are recovered for servicing. This file contains data from a single instrument for a single deployment.  GBROOS is funded by IMOS ï¿½ an initiative of the Australian Government being conducted as part of the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Queensland State Government. GBROOS is managed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and this file contains AIMS data which has been contributed to IMOS. The support of the Tropical Marine Network (University of Sydney, Australian Museum, University of Queensland and James Cook University) who run research stations at One Tree, Lizard, Heron and Orpheus Islands, respectively, on the GBR is also acknowledged.
