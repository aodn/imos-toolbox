function var = getVar(vars, name)
%GETVAR Finds and returns the index of the variable with the given name from 
% the given cell array of variables. If the array does not contain a variable 
% of the given name, 0 is returned.
%
% This function is simply a for loop - it saves having to repeat the same
% code elsewhere.
%
% Inputs:
%   vars - Cell array of variable structs.
%   name - Name of the variable in question.
%
% Outputs:
%   var  - Index into the vars array, specifying the variable with the
%          given name, or 0 if the variable wasn't found.
