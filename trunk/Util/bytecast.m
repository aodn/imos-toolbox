function value = bytecast(bytes, endianness, dataType, cpuEndianness)
%BYTECAST Cast a vector of bytes to the given type. 
%
% This function is used by the Nortek Paradopp and Teledyne workhorse ADCP
% parsers. Raw data files read in by both of these parsers store data in
% little endian.
% 
% Inputs:
%   bytes      - vector of bytes
%   endianness - endianness of the bytes - 'L' for little, 'B' for big.
%   dataType   - type to cast to, e.g. 'uint8', 'int64' etc.
%   cpuEndianness - endianness of the current CPU's bytes - 'L' for little, 'B' for big.
%
% Outputs:
%   value      - the given bytes cast to the given value.

%         Charles James 2012 added call to swapbytes for opposite endianess
