function selectDepthProfileGeneric( selectCallback, clickCallback )
%SELECTDEPTHPROFILEGENERIC Adds callbacks to the current figure, allowing the 
% user to interact with data in the current depth profile axis using the mouse.
%
% See Graph/TimeSeries/selectTimeSeriesGeneric for more documentation
%
% Inputs:
%   selectCallback - function handle which is called when the user selects
%                    a region.
%
%   clickCallback  - function handle which is called when the user clicks
%                    on a point.
