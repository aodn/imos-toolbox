function graphs = listGraphs()
%LISTGRAPHS Returns a cell array containing the names of all available
%graphing functions.
%
% Graph functions live in the Graph subdirectory, and are named according
% to the format:
%
%   graph[GraphType].m
%
% This function simply searches the subdirectory looking for files which
% match the above pattern, and returns the names of those files, minus the 
% 'graph' prefix, and the '.m' suffix. The graphTimeSeries function is the
% de-facto standard; this entry (if it exists) is explicitly placed at the
% start of the returned cell array.
%
% Outputs:
%   graphs - cell array of strings, each of which is the name of a graph
%            function. The caller must add the 'graph' prefix before
%            converting the name into a callable function.
