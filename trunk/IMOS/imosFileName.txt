% IMOS NetCDF file names are generated from the values given below. Value 
% definitions follow the same syntax as in NetCDF template files. Any fields
% which are not present in this file, or are not given a value, will be given
% a default value.
%
% The following 'workspace' is available for defining values:
%
%   sample_data - The data set for which a filename is being generated.
%   dateFmt     - Format which should be used for date fields.
%   ddb and mat tokens can be used like in the NetCDF templates
%
% The IMOS NetCDF file naming convention is as follows:
%
%   IMOS_<facility_code>_<data_code>_<start_date>_<platform_code>_<file_version>_<product_type>_END<end_date>_C-<creation_date>.nc
%
facility_code = 
data_code     = 
start_date    = 
platform_code = 
file_version  = 
product_type  = 
end_date      = 
creation_date =
