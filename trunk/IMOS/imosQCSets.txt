% A list of all supported QC sets, and the possible flag values for each. The 
% set numbers/descriptions, and flag values/descriptions have been copied 
% verbatim from section 6.2 of the IMOS NetCDF User's Manual.
%
% This file is divided into two sections; the first section contains all 
% supported IMOS QC sets, in the following format:
% 
%   id, description
%
% The second section contains lists of the flag values for each of the QC
% sets, in the following format:
%
%   qc_id, flag_value, description, colour, class [class ...]
%
% The first three fields are self explanatory; the fourth field is a matlab 
% colour specification (rgb values onoly)which defines the colour that should 
% be used when a flag of that type is displayed on a graph. 
%
% The fifth field is a space-separated list of a subset of the following:
%
%             'raw': The data is raw
%            'good': The data is good
%    'probablyGood': The data is probably good
%             'bad': The data is bad 
%     'probablyBad': The data is probably bad
%         'missing': The data is missing
%         'changed': The data has been changed
%    'interpolated': The data has been interpolated
%           'bound': The data is out of bounds 
%             'seq': The data is out of sequence
%            'test': The data has failed a test
%          'unreal': The data is unrealistic
%         'discont': The data is discontinuous
%            'land': The data is over land
%             'dup': The data is a duplicate
%         'suspect': The data is suspect
%           'spike': The data has spiked
%            'step': The data has stepped
%
% These are intended as QC set independent 'classes' of QC flags, that can
% be applied to data without knowledge of which QC set is in use. This section
% provides the mapping between these classes, and between actual flag values
% for each set.

3, BOM quality control procedure (SST and Air-Sea fluxes)
