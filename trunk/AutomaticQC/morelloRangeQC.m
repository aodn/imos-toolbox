function [data, flags, log] = morelloRangeQC( sample_data, data, k, auto )
%MORELLORANGE Flags value out of a climatology range.
%
% Range test which finds and flags any data which value doesn't fit in the
% range [min max] = climRange(lon, lat, date, depth, param)
%
% Inputs:
%   sample_data - struct containing the data set.
%
%   data        - the vector of data to check.
%
%   k           - Index into the sample_data variable vector.
%
%   auto        - logical, run QC in batch mode
%
% Outputs:
%   data        - same as input.
%
%   flags       - Vector the same length as data, with flags for flatline 
%                 regions.
%
%   log         - Empty cell array.
