function sam = qcFilter(sam, filterName, auto, rawFlag, goodFlag, probGoodFlag, probBadFlag, badFlag, cancel)
%QCFILTER Runs the given data set through the given automatic Prep QC filters
% and Main QC filters. This is only relevant for Real Time data that needs
% to go through Prep QC filters. For regular delayed mode data this should
% be transparent as the result of the Prep QC is not re-used next.
%
% Inputs:
%   sam         - Cell array of sample data structs, containing the data
%                 over which the qc routines are to be executed.
%   filterName  - String name of the QC test to be applied.
%   auto        - Optional boolean argument. If true, the automatic QC
%                 process is executed automatically (interesting, that),
%                 i.e. with no user interaction.
%   rawFlag     - flag for non QC'd status.
%   goodFlag    - flag for good QC test status.
%   probGoodFlag- flag for probably good QC test status.
%   probBadFlag - flag for probably bad QC test status.
%   badFlag     - flag for bad QC test status.
%   cancel      - cancel QC app process integer code.
%
% Outputs:
%   sam         - Same as input, after QC routines have been run over it.
%                 Will be empty if the user cancelled/interrupted the QC
%                 process.
