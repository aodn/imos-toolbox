function sam = qcFilterPrep( sam, filtername )
%QCFILTERPREP is only relevant for Real Time data that needs
% to go through Prep QC filters. For regular delayed mode data this should
% be transparent and leads straight to the regular main QC filters.
%
% Inputs:
%   sam         - Cell array of sample data structs, containing the data
%                 over which the qc routines are to be executed.
%   filterName  - String name of the QC test to be applied.
%
% Outputs:
%   sam         - Same as input, after QC routines have been run over it.
