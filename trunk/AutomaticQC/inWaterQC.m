function [data flags log] = inWaterQC( sample_data, data, k, type, auto )
%INWATERQC Flags samples which were taken before the instrument was placed
% in the water.
%
% Flags all samples from the data set which have a time that is before the 
% in water time. Assumes that these samples will be at the beginning of the
% data set.
%
% Inputs:
%   sample_data - struct containing the entire data set and dimension data.
%
%   data        - the vector of data to check.
%
%   k           - Index into the sample_data.variables vector.
%
%   type        - dimensions/variables type to check in sample_data.
%
%   auto        - logical, run QC in batch mode
%
% Outputs:
%   data        - Same as input.
%
%   flags       - Vector the same size as data, with before in-water samples 
%                 flagged. 
%
%   log         - Empty cell array..
