function sample_data = XRParse( filename, mode )
%XRPARSE Parses a data file retrieved from an RBR XR420 or XR620 depth 
% logger.
%
% This function is able to read in a single file retrieved from an RBR
% XR420 or XR620 data logger generated using RBR Windows v 6.13 software 
% or Ruskin software. The pressure data is returned in a sample_data
% struct.
%
% Inputs:
%   filename    - Cell array containing the name of the file to parse.
%   mode        - Toolbox data type mode ('profile' or 'timeSeries').
%
% Outputs:
%   sample_data - Struct containing imported sample data.
