function setParserNameForInstrument( make, model, parser )
%SETPARSERNAMEFORINSTRUMENT Saves the given parser-instrument mapping.
%
% The file instruments.txt contains mappings between instrument
% makes/models and the corresponding parsers to use. This function allows you 
% to add new mappings. Given an instrument make/model and a parser, it will
% save that mapping to instruments.txt.
%
% The parser functions are named in the format '[name]Parse' - this
% function requires the '[name]' element of the parser function name.
%
% Inputs:
%   make   - Instrument make.
%   model  - Instrument model.
%   parser - Parser name
