function v = readNetCDFVar(ncid, varid)
%READNETCDFVAR Creates a struct containing data for the given variable id.
%
% This function is able to import an IMOS compliant NetCDF file.
%
% Inputs:
%   v    - struct containing data for a given variable.
%
% Outputs:
%   ncid - netCDF file id.
%
%   varid - variable id in netCDF.
