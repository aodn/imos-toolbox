function str = cellStructCons(structs, fieldname, delimiter)
%CELLSTRUCTCONS Retrieves the given field from the given structs, and
% returns a string of those fields, separated by the given delimiter.
%
% Inputs:
%   structs   - cell array of structs, all containing a field with the 
%               given fieldname.
%   fieldname - name of the field to concatenate.
%   delimiter - Delimiter to use.
%
% Outputs:
%   str       - A string containing the fields of the given struct,
%               concatenated with the given delimiter.
