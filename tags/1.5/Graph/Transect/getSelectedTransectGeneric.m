function dataIdx = getSelectedTransectGeneric( ...
  sample_data, var, ax, highlight, click )
%GETSELECTEDTRANSECTGENERIC Returns the indices of the currently selected 
% (highlighted) data on the given axis.
%
% This function is nearly identical to
% Graph/TimeSeries/getSelectedTimeSeriesGeneric.m.
%
% Inputs:
%   sample_data - Struct containing the data set.
%   var         - Variable in question (index into sample_data.variables).
%   ax          - Axis in question.
%   highlight   - Handle to the highlight object.
%   click       - Where the user clicked the mouse.
%   
%
% Outputs:
%   dataIdx     - Vector of indices into the data, defining the indices
%                 which are selected (and which were clicked on).
