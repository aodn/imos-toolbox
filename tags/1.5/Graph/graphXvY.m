function [graphs lines vars] = graphXvY( parent, sample_data, vars )
%GRAPHTRANSECT Graphs the first two variables from the given data set
% against each other on an X-Y axis.
%
% Inputs:
%   parent             - handle to the parent container.
%   sample_data        - struct containing sample data.
%   vars               - Indices of variables that should be graphed..
%
% Outputs:
%   graphs             - A vector of handles to axes on which the data has 
%                        been graphed.
%   lines              - A matrix of handles to line or surface (or other) 
%                        handles which have been drawn, the same length as 
%                        graphs.
%   vars               - Indices of variables which were graphed.
