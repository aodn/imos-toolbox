function [data, comment] = readVemcoCsv(dataLines, procHeader)
%readVemcoCsv Processes data section from a Vemco .csv file.
%
% This function is able to process data retrieved from a converted (.csv)
% data file generated by the Vemco Vue Logger program. This
% function is called from VemcoParse. Code modelled on readSBE37cnv.m
%
% Inputs:
%   dataLines - cell array of columns of raw data.
%   procHeader - Struct containing processed header.
%
% Outputs:
%   data       - Struct containing variable data.
%   comment    - Struct containing variable comment.

%CONVERTDATA In order to future proof the .csv file, utilize the same ideal
% as for reading SBE37 data. This function is just a big switch statement which takes
% column header as input, and attempts to convert it to IMOS compliant name and
% unit of measurement. Returns empty string/vector if the parameter is not
% supported.
