function imosToolbox(auto, varargin)
%IMOSTOOLBOX Starts the IMOS toolbox.
%
% This function is the entry point for the IMOS toolbox.
%
% Inputs:
%   auto     - optional String parameter - if 'auto', the toolbox is executed
%              automatically, with no user interaction. Any other string will
%              result in the toolbox being executed normally.
%   varargin - In 'auto' mode, any other parameters passed in are passed 
%              through to the autoIMOSToolbox function - see the
%              documentation for that function for details.

%    -now adds any .jar found in Java directory to the path so that any driver
%    can be used to connect to a deployment database for example.
