% This file specifies how Depth should be computed when an instrument on a 
% mooring doesn't have any pressure sensor. It enables the user to restrict 
% the other instruments in the mooring with pressure information to be
% considered when calculating Depth for another without pressure information. 
% It is used by the depthPP.m function. 
%
% Each line is of the format:
%
%   option,     value
%
% where option can be used as follow :
%
% -same_family : Values can be yes or no. If value is yes, then only data 
% sets with strings in their global attribute 'instrument' having something
% in common will be considered. Ex. : In a mooring equiped with an ADCP, a 
% WQM, Aqualoggers 520PT and Aqualoggers 520T, the depth of the Aqualoggers
% 520T will be computed taking into account Aqualoggers 520PT pressure data
% only.
%
% -include : list of space delimited strings to be compared with data sets 
% global attribute 'instrument'. If it has anything in common, this data 
% set will be considered in the Depth computation.
% Ex. : include,        Aqualoggers
%
% -exclude : list of space delimited strings to be compared with data sets 
% global attribute 'instrument'. If it has anything in common, this data 
% set will not be considered in the Depth computation.
% Ex. : exclude,        ADCP WQM
