%IMOSTILTVELOCITYSETQC Quality control procedure for ADCP instrument data against their tilt.
%
% Quality control ADCP velocity data, assessing the tilt of the instrument.
%
% The tilt of the instrument plays into a number of factors:
%          -We need to know the tilt in order to convert from along the beam to 
%           horizontal and vertical components
%          -We need to know the tilt in order to map the bins from different 
%           beams to the same place in the water column
%          -The compass errors increase with increasing tilts.
%
% Finally, most tilt sensors output is scaled and reaches a maximum at
% some specific angle so that any measured angle equals or greater than this 
% maximum means that the measured velocity data is not reliable.
%
% Inputs:
%   sample_data - struct containing the entire data set and dimension data.
%   auto - logical, run QC in batch mode
%
% Outputs:
%   sample_data - same as input, with QC flags added for variable/dimension
%                 data.
%   varChecked  - cell array of variables' name which have been checked
%   paramsLog   - string containing details about params' procedure to include in QC log
%
% More RDI details below from Darryl.Symonds@Teledyne.com on Thu 18/12/2014 :
%
% The Sentinel V, can provide tilts basically in full circle around the instrument. 
% The WorkHorse tilt sensor output is scaled and reaches a maximum at either :
%   ~22 degrees for Sentinel/Monitor, 
%   ~50 degrees for the Long Ranger and QuarterMaster.
%
% Coordinate Transformation
% -------------------------
% Converting from along the beams (radial) velocities to horizontal and vertical 
% components is done using the beam angle of the transducer +/- the tilt of the 
% instrument.  Very basic trigonometry is applied here.   If the instrument is 
% tilted over by more than the tilt sensors can measure then (i.e. >22degrees 
% in a WH) there is no way to resolve the math and so you no longer are sure 
% that the vertical component and horizontal component have been calculated 
% properly.  However, if you know something about the area that you are operating 
% in, and if the vertical component has a mean of zero with some shear up and 
% down the profile then you can look at your data and see if the vertical 
% velocities being reported are doing this.  If they are then you can “feel” 
% good about the data you have.  If however the vertical component appears to 
% be biased off of zero then you know that the tilts were exceeded by much more 
% than the maximum tilt reported and now you cannot trust the data.
%  
% Note this is all subjective and if you are trying to measure to the accuracy 
% of our specification then you pretty much cannot trust velocity data once 
% you reach the maximum tilt of the instrument. 
%  
% Bin Mapping
% -----------
% Our bin mapping algorithm uses the tilt data to make sure that the correct 
% bins along each the beams are used when creating the horizontal velocities. 
% If you have small tilts, say <5 degrees, then the there is very little “bin 
% mapping” required until you get very far away from the ADCP.    
%  
% To help illustrate this please picture the ADCP so that it tilts only on one 
% axis.  The tilt now is so great that one beam is horizontal.  It has no 
% vertical profile at all.  None of its bins will map to the position of the 
% other 3 beams that are pointing somewhat vertically in the water column.
%  
% Now as you have less tilt what you will see is that near bins map out in the 
%same vertical position for all 4 beams.  However, as you move further away 
% from the instrument the tilt magnifies the difference in vertical position 
% in the water column and causes one bin a particular beam to be lower than 
% another bin in a different / opposite beam.  
%  
% If the tilt sensor has reached its maximum then this bin mapping cannot be 
% accurately applied.  The result is that bins from different vertical depths 
% in the water may be used in the coordinate transformed data.  The result is 
% that the velocities are smeared over the depth of the instrument.   
%  
% Again, if you are trying to measure to the accuracy of our specification 
% then you pretty much cannot trust velocity data once you reach the maximum 
% tilt of the instrument.
%  
% Compass
% -------
% Our standard specification for our compass assumes the system will be with 
% tilts of around +/-15 degrees. The errors in the compass will increase beyond 
% this and can be in 10’s of degrees rather than the +/-2 degrees you can 
% achieve with the field calibration.     
%  
% The reason is that the flux gate compass is measuring the earth’s horizontal 
% magnetic field strength.  As you tilt the instrument over the sensors on the 
% compass are now pointing at a different angle relative the earth’s horizontal 
% magnetic field and less energy is actually measured. This is the same 
% phenomenon as what happens as you near the magnetic poles. The difference 
% is that the earth’s magnetic field is what is changing and at the poles the 
% magnetic field becomes vertical.

% The Nortek Principle of Operation document says :
%
% Page 19, chapter 1.1.6.3 Pitch, Roll and Heading
% ------------------------------------------------
% Tilt readings between 20° and 30° affect the data accuracy in a way that is 
% likely to make the data fail to meet the specifications. Data acquired during 
% tilts exceeding 30° are in general not reliable and should be discarded.
