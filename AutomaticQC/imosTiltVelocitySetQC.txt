% Definitions and descriptions of 2-level thresholds for tilts of ADCPs
% and Current Meters.
%
% These information are used in the TiltVelocityQC test.
% These thresholds values were taken from RDI and Nortek documentations
% and exchanges with RDI technicians.
%
% For RDI ADCPs, compass measurements are affected and fail to meet
% specifications when the first threshold is exceeded, while when the
% second threshold is exceeded coordinates transform and bin-mapping
% operations are also affected.
%
% For Nortek ADCPs, velocity data accuracy fails to meet specifications
% when the first threshold is exceeded. When the second is exceeded then
% velocity data becomes unreliable.
%
% For Nortek Current meters, data accuracy fails to meet specifications
% when beyond 30deg. Some cases appears to still meet reasonable
% quality when below 45deg.
