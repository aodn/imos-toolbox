% Definitions and descriptions of 2-level thresholds for tilts of ADCPs
%
% These information are used in the ADCP tilt QC test.
% These thresholds values were taken from RDI and Nortek documentations 
% and exchanges with RDI technicians.
% 
% For RDI ADCPs, compass measurements are affected and fail to meet 
% specifications when the first threshold is exceeded, while when the 
% second threshold is exceeded coordinates transform and bin-mapping 
% operations are also affected.
%
% For Nortek ADCPs, velocity data accuracy fails to meet specifications 
% when the first threshold is exceeded. When the second is exceeded then 
% velocity data becomes unreliable.
