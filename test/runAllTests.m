function [results] = runAllTests(parallel)
% function  = runAllTests(parallel)
%
% Run all toolbox tests
%
% Inputs:
%
% parallel - boolean to run the tests in parallel
%    - Default to False
%      Reason: Memory usage is too high and CPU usage is too low.
%
% Outputs:
%
% results - the resulted unittest structure for all tests
%
