function dataIdx = getSelectedTimeSeriesGeneric( ...
  sample_data, var, ax, highlight )
%GETSELECTEDTIMESERIESGENERIC Returns the indices of the currently selected 
% (highlighted) data on the given axis.
%
% Inputs:
%   sample_data - Struct containing the data set.
%   var         - Variable in question (index into sample_data.variables).
%   ax          - Axis in question.
%   highlight   - Handle to the highlight object.
%   
%
% Outputs:
%   dataIdx     - Vector of indices into the data, defining the indices
%                 which are selected (and which were clicked on).
